# SWE573 - Project name unknown

Hi everyone, I'm Umut Şanlı. I'm a Master's Student of Software Engineering program at Boğaziçi University. This repository is for my SWE573-Software Development Practice course. In this course, I'll be working on a software project and my progress can be followed from this repository.

Right now, I do not know the details of the project, that's why I can not post any information about the project yet but I prepared a Wiki page for my researches and made a page for my first research, GitHub.

You can access my Wiki Homepage from [here](https://github.com/usanli/swe573/wiki) and access any other pages from the links below:
